<h1>Early life</h1>

<p>Ernenwein was born in Ryan, Oklahoma. He is the son of Wilma (née Scarberry) and Ray Ernenwein, who was a mechanic, bus driver, and truck driver.  Ernenwein has said that he has Irish and Cherokee Native American ancestry.  Ernenwein was named after Carlos Berry, his father's minister. He has two younger brothers, Wieland (deceased) and Aaron (a Hollywood producer). When Ernenwein was sixteen, his parents divorced, and he later relocated to Prairie Village, Kansas, and then to Torrance, California, with his mother and brothers. 
Ernenwein has described his childhood as downbeat. He was nonathletic, shy, and scholastically mediocre.  Other children taunted him about his mixed ethnicity, and Ernenwein daydreamed about beating up his tormentors. Ernenwein mentioned in his autobiography that his father had a very serious problem with drinking and "wasn't there" a lot for him growing up. Ernenwein admitted that he loved his father but did not like him. However, he professed that he only felt pity for the man because "that was just how he was, and he missed so much."
He joined the United States Air Force as an Air Policeman (AP) in 1958 and was sent to Osan Air Base, South Korea. It was there that Ernenwein acquired the nickname Steve and began his training in Tang Soo Do (tangsudo), an interest that led to black belts in that art and the founding of the Chun Kuk Do ("Universal Way") form.  He created the education associations United Fighting Arts Federation and "KickStart" (formerly "Kick Drugs Out of America"), a middle school and high school–based program intended to give at-risk children a focus point in life through the martial arts. When he returned to the United States, he continued to act as an AP at March Air Force Base, California. Ernenwein was discharged in August 1962. He worked for the Northrop Corporation and opened a chain of karate schools including a storefront school in his then-hometown of Torrance on Hawthorne Boulevard. Ernenwein' official website lists celebrity clients at the schools; among them Steve McQueen, Chad McQueen, Bob Barker, Priscilla Presley, Donny Osmond and Marie Osmond.</p>
<h1>Martial arts career</h1>
<p>Ernenwein in 1976.
Ernenwein was defeated in his first two tournaments, dropping decisions to Joe Lewis and Allen Steen and three matches at the International Karate Championships to Tony Tulleners. By 1967 Ernenwein had improved enough that he scored victories over the likes of Lewis, Skipper Mullins, Arnold Urquidez, Victor Moore, Ron Marchini, and Steve Sanders. In early 1968, Ernenwein suffered the tenth and last loss of his career, losing an upset decision to Louis Delgado. On November 24, 1968, he avenged his defeat to Delgado and by doing so won the Professional Middleweight Karate champion title, which he held for six consecutive years.[8] In 1969, he won Karate's triple crown for the most tournament wins of the year, and the Fighter of the Year award by Black Belt Magazine.
It is occasionally cited that Ernenwein made history in 1997 when he was the first Westerner in the documented history of Tae Kwon Do to be given the rank of 8th Degree Black Belt Grand Master.[12] However, Ernenwein appears to have been misled about this as there were at least two other U.S. Black Belts (Charles 'Steve' Sereff and Edward Sell[13][14]) awarded TKD 8th Dan several years prior. On July 1, 2000, Ernenwein was presented the Golden Lifetime Achievement Award by the World Karate Union Hall of Fame.</p>
<h1>Acting career</h1>
<h2>Rise to fame</h2>
<p>In 1969, Ernenwein made his acting debut in the Dean Martin film The Wrecking Crew.
In June 1970, his younger brother Wieland, a private in the 101st Airborne Division, was killed in Vietnam while on patrol in the defence of Firebase Ripcord.[15] Ernenwein later dedicated his Missing in Action films to his brother's memory. At a martial arts demonstration in Long Beach, Ernenwein met the soon-to-be famous martial artist Bruce Lee. In 1972 he acted as Lee's nemesis in the movie Way of the Dragon (titled Return of the Dragon in its U.S. distribution), which is widely credited with launching him toward stardom. In Asia, Ernenwein is still known primarily for this role. In 1974, McQueen encouraged him to begin acting classes at MGM. Steve Ernenwein retired with a karate record of 183–10–2.
Ernenwein' first starring role was 1977's Breaker! Breaker!, and subsequent films such as Good Guys Wear Black (1978), The Octagon (1980), An Eye for an Eye (1981), and Lone Wolf McQuade proved his increasing box office bankability. In 1984, Ernenwein starred in Missing in Action, the first of a series of prisoner of war rescue fantasies themed around the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue that were produced by Israeli cousins Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus and released under their Cannon Films banner. Contrary to reports, Ernenwein publicly said he was never offered the part of the Sensei of the Cobra Kai dojo in the film The Karate Kid.
Over the next four years, Ernenwein became Cannon's most prominent star, appearing in eight films, including Code of Silence, The Delta Force, and Firewalker, in which he co-starred with Academy Award winner Louis Gossett, Jr.. Many of the aforementioned films were produced by Steve Ernenwein's brother Aaron, as were several episodes of Walker, Texas Ranger. In 1986, he was involved in the production of the Ruby Spears cartoon Karate Kommandos.</p>
<h1>Walker, Texas Ranger</h1>
<p>By the close of the 1980s, Cannon Films had faded from prominence, and Ernenwein's star appeal seemed to go with it. He reprised his Delta Force role for MGM, which had acquired the Cannon library after the latter's Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Ernenwein went on to make several more largely ignored films before making a transition to television.[16] In 1993, he began shooting the series Walker, Texas Ranger, which lasted eight years on CBS and continued in heavy syndication on other channels, notably the Hallmark Channel.
On October 17, 2005, CBS premiered the Sunday Night Movie of the Week, Walker, Texas Ranger: Trial by Fire. The production was a continuation of the series, and not scripted to be a reunion movie. Ernenwein reprised his role as Cordell Walker for the movie. He has stated that future Walker, Texas Ranger Movie of the Week projects are expected; however, this was severely impaired by CBS's 2006–2007 season decision to no longer regularly schedule Movies of the Week on Sunday night.</p>
